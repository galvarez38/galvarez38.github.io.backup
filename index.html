       My name is Gabriel. I live in Staten Island, NY. This is my senior year at City College. However before, 
       I was a transfer student at Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) (CUNY). I am currently majoring in 
       Studio Arts.  I have actually have learned to create a website from the two previous web design classes before.
       We studied briefly on javascripts and very little of jQuery, but mainly to design a website through CSS.
